<h1>Research findings</h1>

<h2>by Warren Murombe</h2>
  
<p>To include findings on the subject, its history, context and key figures. (Researcher)</p>

<h3>Findings on the subject</h3>

<p>I provided the second storyboard which was I originally developed to help structure what information I would share from the surplus research data as I converted to information, it helped me focus what was looking for having such a board subject structure, Still I presented it to the group and it was used as a main story board of the documentary not the final one as mine still was incomplete in a realistic sense given the assignment parameters.“They may produce original program ideas for consideration by producers, broadcasters, production companies, or other decision makers. They identify relevant data, contributors, locations or archive material etc. collate and assess information from various sources, and ensure that legal, compliance and copyright requirements are met.”Media-match, 2014
</p>

<h3>History and context</h3>

<p>Identifying and covering a wide spectrum of thoughts processes that can occur for our actor’s character. Helped a lot in my research getting into the mind of what a student would look for if considering a vegan/vegetarian diet this also helped because myself as a vegan.</p>
<p>Finding interviewee’s was quite complex having so many suitable candidates “Research and preparation are the key to an effective interview. By the time you sit down to do the interview, you should know as much-or even more-about the topic than he interviewiee.”mollison,2010,Florence onus producer  With this in mind finding potential candidates I narrowed it down to three, unfortunately one was unavailable logistical reasons resulted in us calling off arrangement.

</p>


 <p>”you don’t need to be an expert in the subject-they are-but you need to know right questions to ask to elicit their most informative and dynamic Reponses ”donna kenny,2010,producing videos
The first was Ann turner head of Manchester metropolitan university sport and nutrition to provide a more academic overview perceptive, the second with Alex Connell principal tutor at Cordon Vert Vegetarian Cookery School a seasoned adroit chef and finally the sagacious erudite Dr Ra Un Nefer Amen a spiritual teacher and metaphysician that was cancelled.</p>

<p>“Before the day of the shoot, everyone should be given, in writing, call sheet” I provided details by email, speech and WhatsApp to all members of the group at least three day prior to interviews.
</p>

<p>“…a list of key questions or topics. The director, researcher and host should have a preproduction meeting in which they discuss the questions/topics ahead of time and decide the order in which they will be addressed” 2010, producing videos
we had pre talks before shooting on the day. Telephones  email with myself and the interviewee’s questions were asked based on findings and our documentary’s scenario directions we raised to give the interviewee’s a understanding of what is expected of them and what they’d like to add as they were very open willing to give of themselves completely. For example we began with Alex Connell planning to have 6 meals however reasoning lead us to make the interview to what we considered to be more pertinent by producing footage for breakfast lunch and dinner.
</p>

<p>The context was narrowed by sharing information that could be used for thoughts on the V-log and interview questions to guide the direction, which if needed I could supply more in-depth if required by the director.
Information on teeth to add context, suffice of why conditions for someone would consider becoming vegan when cognitive making life style decision.

 <h3>Key figures</h3>
 
<p>“Where Do You Get Your Calcium
Calcium needs are actually lower than people think. You need only about 400-500 mg a day and plant foods are your best source. 
</p>
<ul>

<li>Leafy Greens</li>
<li>Broccoli</li>
<li>Brussels sprouts</li>
<li>Collard Greens</li>
<li>Kale</li>
<li>Swiss Chard</li>
<li>Oranges</li>
<li>Sweet Potatoes</li> 
 <li>Bok Choy</li>
  <li>Chick Peas</li>
   <li>Green Beans</li>
    <li>Pinto Beans</li>
     <li>Tofu</li>
     <li>Soy</li>
     
</ul>

 
<p>To replace milk drink nut milks like almond milk, soy milk, and rice milk are good options too. 
The list really can go on. As long as you eat a diverse whole food plant based diet you don’t have to worry about counting the mg of Calcium.</p>
<p>Other things to do is exercise and get out in the sun. The Vitamin D from the sun helps to control the calcium levels in your body. Don’t use sunscreen, but gradually sit for longer periods of time in the sun”Lailah Morid,online,2013
</p> 
 
<p>“Amount of animals killed a year, statistics. 
U.S. alone:
animals (mostly chickens) killed for food: 8 billion
Marine animals (fish and shellfish) killed for food: 100 billion” peta,2014,online

<p>Teeth						Online,2012, arcoirisuniversal
Your “canine” teeth and his are not the same. And there’s a good reason for that: Dogs evolved their teeth for tearing raw flesh and crunching bones. Ours evolved for chewing and breaking down plant material. Peta,2013,online
</p>

<p>Extra
“The average guy marries at 27. And although we're sure it's a coincidence, most episodes of major depression start around the same time. Perhaps the cause is a culmination of twenty something stressors—the kind that come with 70-hour workweeks and late nights on the pub circuit.

But it's not just your mind that pays the price. A busy, high-stress lifestyle often leads to a diet of convenience—one that's lacking in vitamins and minerals, and overloaded with sugar, fat, and calories. The result: a body that never realizes its full potential.

See, this is the decade when your levels of muscle-building hormones—testosterone, DHEA, and growth hormone—hit their peak, making it the best time for you to pack on muscle. It's also your last chance to lay down new bone; by the time you're 30, your skeletal system is set. A poor diet not only inhibits your ability to do both, but also increases your risk of disease, weight gain, and mental breakdown—now, and for decades down the road.

But you can fight back with food; start today and you'll build a body that will last a lifetime.” Online,phillips Rhodes.

<h3>Events</h3>
<p>Found a event the promoting vegan and vegetarians lifestyle, it opened up a lot of doors for potential direction when selecting candidates.
</p>

<p>
Helping others
“Spot particular points of stress in the team and help out.”
During the research weeks I uncovered information on the roles for my team mates that was shared on Moodle.
“Even if a scene only calls for one mic, I still recommend using two mics as often possible. These dual-mic setups take more time and effort “the shut up and shoot free-lance guide.2012, Anthony. Q Artis</p>
<p>This was a technique that could been done during our first recording of an MMU vegan vegetarian event and to any further event we’d go to unfortunately there were no other events of a similar nature. Also our audio for the first interview however was affected undesirably due to external interference 
In addition pages 86 to 92”5 wireless mic tips” which states the procedures for setting up the equipment and use of lav mics.</p>
<p>Which could mitigated onset confusion with the equipment in hindsight and also produce increase potentially better quality end product of our project.
Another research finding I came across “common facial issues and fixes” the shut up and shoot free-lance guide.2012, Anthony. Q Artis which was added for interview reasons our interview were prime quality, which was a result in our finished production in visual and audio respect.</p>
