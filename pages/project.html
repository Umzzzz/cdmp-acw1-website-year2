<h1>Project journey</h1>


<h2>Kamaal Khanum-Williams </h2>

<p>Project Journey – to include the tasks undertaken for the project, a PDF of the submitted proposal, and a discussion of the stylistic vision for the film (Director) </p>

<h3>Tasks undertaken</h3>

<p>While filming there was many considerations that had to be made, due to set backs. The sound had been a major downfall to the documentary. Which stopped the progress of the film in the beginning so as the director a decision was made on the day of a shoot. The sound was not out putting leading us to go into a interview with no audio output this was a major set back as we went in without no sound check. This was a big mistake, which was later revealed after filming. As Artis points out “don’t let the whole day’s shoot go to crap because of a single set back”. (2014:108) We adjusted our self’s after the shoot and later was able to reshoot the scene.</p>

<p>According to Artis “bad audio is an unforgiveable video sin ”(2014:186) in audio which we was well aware of but it was decided to take a chance. Which back fired tremendously as there was too many back ground noises. This led to the interview with one of our first interviewees Ann Turner being re-shot except this time having the audio fixed we proceeded with caution to avoid any more set backs. </p>


<p>While shooting we had the goals we wanted to achieve while filming but sticking to the exact storyboard we had created just didn’t work as plans do change which meant we started to “shoot your story with an open mind”.(Bernard:2004) Since we didn’t have much time to decide on when re shooting was possible we got what we could. Sticking to the exact storyboard would have hindered us greatly, which was the reason why there was more than one version of storyboard.</p>


<p>During the interviews the decision was made to have the interviewees to have their answers included in the question. As Bernard points out “ask the person being interviewed to incorporate part of your question in his or her answer”.(2004:149) The reason behind, this was due to documentary having a strong narrative that was created solely by the interviewer instead of it being a predictable set of interviews with the questions being heard on camera and they answer.</p>

<p>This gave the three different interviews authenticity to the narrative. The locations needed to be thoroughly checked in advance before each shoot. This decision was made to capitalise on the control we could have. Artis states “the less control you have over an interview environment the more headache you will have”. (2014:94) We found this method helped the interviews progress run much smoother, as we were able to identify the potential problems giving us more control.</p>

<p>Finally, aside from handling the interviews,  location and sound tasks making the interviewees comfortable remained priority throughout the film by having them in a comfortable environment. As Artis points out “the best location for interviews will be a room in your subjects home or place of occupation”. (2014:94) Having the interviewee in their own environment allowed them to be more expressive verbally. Which gave us some great responses that may not have been possible if we chose the locations our self’s.</p>

<p>Inclusion, the project had many great aspects that lead us to getting the great piece that we did. This doesn’t mean any improvements couldn’t have been made as the director one of the main changes that could have been done would be to have more time on planning the documentary out to make sure more of the potential problems could have been identified as many was missed out i.e interview cancellations and sound checks.</p>

<h3>Stylistic vision for the film</h3>

<p>Pre production this was a very pivotal part of the documentary process, as it was the first task that would set stylistic vision for the documentary. As the director of the documentary the vision was to create a piece that would be enjoyable as well as informative.</p> 
 
<p>The brain storm, was to have everyone in the group put forward their ideas which was then decided which idea would be the most promising for the group as well as fit with stylistic vision. The documentary idea was chosen, to be about what a vegan / vegetarian is? Which is a subject not many of the public have much knowledge about and can be greatly informative in a documentary. </p>


<p>Once the decision had been made to create the documentary based on this idea, some issues had to be identified the first being what locations and in what style could this keep the audience interested. In order to achieve this background research on ideas was done. The most suitable style found was to create this piece, would be to do it in a Vlog style. Which included doing multiple days on findings around what a vegan/vegetarian is. </p>
<p>This idea came from the hugely successful Vlog done on YouTube with over 2 million hits. A similar Vlog style would work to a great effect, as the audience would follow the journey of the character they can relate to. We found it’s important to have a compelling narrative as Bernard suggests that it is critical to “reach people with a subject and story that grabs them”. (2004:33) Our group found this could be achieved by using the Vlog journey as the narrative to link the documentary together. </p>

<p>Working closely with the researcher, during pre production we established which interviewee would be the most promising for the documentary narrative. While going through interviewees that we found it was decided to make a check listed that would bring context to the documentary. One of the final stages of the preproduction of the documentary was narrowing down the strong candidates. As Artis suggests “the people you ultimately choose to speak on your topic are equally crucial to the success of your doc”.(2014:11) Otherwise we would have a some people who didn’t quite fit the purpose of the film. </p>

<p>Also the locations had to be carefully considered, as some places needed permission to film at. As Rabiger indicates permission “must be cleared by the relevant authority unless you care to run risk being taken to court”.(2009:376) However, we managed to get the permission from the authority before the interviews by calling or emailing them. Having the considerations completed, a loose storyboard was created which would allow the team to have space to make changes should if needed.</p>
