<h1>Capturing sound</h1>
 
<h2>by Umair Yaquoob</h2>


<h3>Introduction to the use of sound</h3>

<p>What is sound? Is sound what is heard in a conversation? Is it the audio on television? Sound is highly significant when it comes to filmmaking as it plays a big part of the narration for your documentary. You can get away with poor quality footage recordings as you can save this through the editing phase. However, if you have a finished film with poor sound quality then your audience will notice this immediately and lead to a bad reputation, people will class you as an amateur. In filmmaking, you have to consider everything when it comes to sound from location of shooting, atmosphere and background noise.  Lyver (1999) states, “In simple terms sound is thought of as movement of air caused by a vibrating body, but is actually a little more complex.” (Lyver: 1999:3)</p>

<p>Our documentary is about the lifestyle of veganism. My role for this project was audio operator.  It was my duty to ensure good quality sound was captured for the documentary. My role started at the pre-production phase where pre-location check was required before the actual film shooting took place. The reason for this was to analyse what the sound would be like in regards to the suitability of the location. Lyver (1999) states, “Every location should have been visited by the director and or PA and there should be either a plan of the location or, at the very least, lots of notes about it.” (Lyver: 1999: 61)</p>

<p>One of the main factors of my role was to monitor the sound level on the camera and work closely with the director and camera operator to vision the use of sound for our documentary. The way we used sound in our documentary is via interviewing and vox pops. In addition, we used voice over music to play its part in the narration of the story. Our documentary consisted of aspects of the lifestyle of veganism by asking people if they knew what veganism was, interviews with specialised people in the vegan society, a member of the team who is trying the vegan lifestyle in a seven day vlog and comparisons on facts and figures comparing vegan eaters to meat eaters. In regards to voice over music, we chose chilled and relaxed music as we thought this was ideal for our topic. </p>



<h3>Technological techniques</h3>

<p>In regards to technological techniques numerous techniques were used to capture the sound of the documentary while filming. These came under the sound equipment. The equipment used to hear sound were headphones to keep our background noise and listen for any unnecessary sound that was not needed in our film. In addition, throughout the project the headphones were used to hear if our subjects were clear while they were talking through the mics. Cherrier (2007) states, “In the field, sound monitoring is always done through headphones during actual sound recording. Headphones with isolation pads are essential so that the sound person can be certain that what they are hearing is only the audio being picked up by the microphone.” (Cherrier: 2007:322)</p>

<p>On the other hand, when we were filming interviews for our documentary it was decided that the lavalier microphone is better to use, as this is popular in the industry to conduct interviews. The main reason why this type of mic is used is due to its clarity and only picks up sound from the subject who is talking through the mic. Another reason is that it looks professional when you watch the film back as you can hide unnecessary wires out of the frame and hide the mic under the subject’s collar. Cherrier (2007) states, “Lavalieres are tiny, clip-on mikes that can be attached to a lapel or tie, or easily hidden under a collar, and are used for close miking talent.” (Cherrier: 2007:314)</p>

<p>The majority of time when we were shooting on location we used the boom mics, as it is directional. It picks up sound in direct to where the subject is and shuts out unnecessary background noise but careful enough that it picked up the relevant sound. This type of mic makes your subject comfortable, as they do not need to worry about the mics they can just move freely without disturbing the sound. Anderson (2012) states, “Most commonly you will use a shotgun microphone on a boom pole so you can get clean audio from your actor without all the ambient background noise.” (Anderson: 2012:43)</p>
 
<h3>Stylistic techniques</h3>
 
<p>In regards to stylistic techniques, we considered how we want our audience to feel from listening to our documentary. The way in which interviews are conducted and the tone of narration we wanted to set. When it came to interviews, we did not want the tedious direct yes or no answers. We wanted our interviewees to elaborate on the answers they give to our asked questions. The way we achieve this was to plan the question prior to the interview so that we went in fully prepared for all our interviews to get the best possible answers from our interviewees.</p> 
 
<p>On the other hand, in regards to music, we used smooth and relaxed music to go with our documentary to contribute to the visuals. However, at the same time we did not want the music to overpower the story we are portraying to our audience. We got the music from copyright free website.</p>

<p> To summarise, as the audio operator it was ensured that all the sound equipment was working to high standards before we conduct all shooting for our documentary. The locations we chose to shoot parts of our documentary were in a great condition to record. In addition, the unnecessary background noise had to be kept minimum. Finally, the sound had to have true feel towards what we were portraying in our documentary about veganism. </p>
