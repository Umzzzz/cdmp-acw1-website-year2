<h1>Filming the project</h1>

<h3>Introduction to approach to filming</h3>

<p>The capturing of visuals for our video was an important task as it would lead to the vision of our chosen topic of Veganism and Vegetarianism being put on screen. All footage taken would have to be relevant and correctly and eloquently set the tone and stylistic conventions of the documentary genre. Within this project, several other documentaries and food programmes were investigated in order to understand how to film food products, and how an investigative documentary should be filmed. With a greater understanding into how a documentary should be filmed, we wanted shots that would complement our piece and not undermine what we were trying to represent on screen.</p> 

<p>In order to aid the narrative of our documentary, we had to have some kind of story involved. We made it a personal journey of one of our team member investigating the alternative dietary lifestyles so we scripted a meeting of a meat-eater and a Vegan during the opening sequence before the title screen. We included a pan in order to establish the scene and kept it at a mid-shot in order to keep the camera angle low and towards the actors. We utilised a technique known as a Background Reveal so that the individual within the shot is introduced naturally. </p>

<p>We kept open space in order to introduce another individual as Kenworthy, C (2009) advised to “set up your shot so that there’s some empty space, keeping your characters roughly in the middle of the shot” (1) which helped to advance the scene forward. For this technique we had to be careful to keep all camera movements smooth and clean so that “the camera move doesn’t feel forced” (1). For the context of the individuals being students, we shot the scene in a student flat which helped the “Mise-en-scene”. Sikov, E (2010) explained that “everything within the scene has expressive meanings” (3) so we wanted to have meaning of the context within the shots throughout the film.</p>
<h3>Technical and stylistics techniques of filming</h3>

<p>In order for our video content to be factual and personal, we arranged interviews with people within the Vegan and Vegetarian community. We wanted each shot to be able to display relevant information towards the viewer, Edgar-Hunt, R (2010) say that Soviet film-maker Sergei Eisenstein described the shot as “the basic unit of film” (2) so we want our documentary to be visually appealing and dynamic. Edgar-Hunt, R (2010) also discuss that “everything within the frame of the image is selected for its meaning, from the colour of an actress’s dress to the pattern on the wallpaper” (2) so we orchestrated each shot and frame to have some sort of relevant information towards both the context of the scene and the interviewee.</p>
<p>Examples of this include nutritional textbooks during Ann Turner’s interview and the Cordon Vert Cookery School banner towards the right side of the screen during the sequences where Alex Connell is cooking vegetarian/vegan food. We also implemented the Rule of Thirds into each shot and frame to ensure that the frame within the shot was balanced and not too overly cluttered, or uneven with content.</p> 

<p>We also framed the shot during the interviews so that the interviewee was speaking beyond the camera, a standard convention of interviews so that the individual isn’t speaking directly to the viewer but will still be the focus in a mid-angle shot. This would also allow our interviewees to feel more comfortable around the camera so it wasn’t directly in their faces so a more fluid and natural speaking style would be made.</p>

<p>During the cooking sequence halfway through the documentary, we have multiple camera angles with a focused close up of Alex’s chopping board alongside the larger Master Shot overview of the frame. This was done using the filming function of a small Canon DSLR camera and was filmed alongside the cooking preparation in order for the transitions between the shots to feel more natural and dynamic and would have made the editing process feel a lot smoother. If we had filmed those sections separately with same singular camera then it could have made the final product feel very “stop and start” which we wanted to avoid. For these shots we wanted the focus to be entirely on the food and as such we utilised the Close-Up shot technique, a Close-Up being “a shot that isolates and object in the image” (Sikov, E 2010) (3). This sequence was to be all about the food and this frame allowed us to keep the focus entirely on what the chef was doing. The centred focus of this shot also showed that “If a character or object is framed centrally, they are given power over what is in the margins of the screen” (Edgar-Hunt, R 2010) (2) which is the kind of shot that we wanted to express to the viewer. The central framing also applied to the V-log section of the documentary as all the focus would be upon the individual on the screen with no other objects or distractions in the way.</p>

<h3>Handling audio</h3>

<p>I worked closely with the director and editor throughout the production and this allowed me to understand their vision of how the film should be represented and which kind of shots would work on-screen. I also came to understand how these shots would be fundamental to the editor as we worked together throughout all filming occasions, working out which video pieces would go where in the edit and ensuring that they were of a high quality throughout. It was this vital communication with the director also that allowed me to develop storyboards that the whole team was happy with at the planning stage of our documentary which would later be refined.</p>

<p>This project allowed for a lot of creativity within the video and we were able to experiment with our production throughout, this lead to a final product that we are all proud of and each member contributing to the final piece. The knowledge gained from this piece will allow for more creativity and positivity while working within teams in the future.</p>
