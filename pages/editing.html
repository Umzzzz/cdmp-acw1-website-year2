<h1>Framing the story</h1>
 
<h2>by Daniel Hayes</h2>
 
<p>Demonstrate research and learning about representation and the technical aspects of editing (Editor)</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>The position of the editor first drew my attention as I already had previous experience in using the kinds of software needed to produce a documentary video both in my A-level study and my first year of university. The role of the editor is one of the most important roles within a project like this, because it is how the final produce will appear towards the audience therefore the overall presentation of the documentary is in the hands of the overall editor. The editor does this in ways such as transitions and cuts to either show pace within the editing stage or to provoke a different response from the audience.</p> 

<h3>Representation</h3>

<p>To gain the overall best representation of our documentary, we decided to adopt a linear narrative over a non-linear narrative as we believed that this would allow the audience to gain a better understanding of the progress that is taking place on screen. A linear narrative is when the story has a beginning, middle and an end structure “As the name suggests, linear narratives follow a straight line- starting at the beginning, moving to the middle and proceeding to the end of the story.” (Wroblewski: no date: online) this allows a climax to build up within the story to an inevitable conclusion. On the other hand a non-linear narrative has no set order therefore can be produced in any way, such as middle, beginning and end. I believed that a linear approach would be the best form for the documentary to take to allow the viewer to gain an insight into Kamaal’s journey to discover more about the vegan lifestyle, “underlying the experience of the linear narrative is the invitation for the viewer to identify with the main characters” (Dancyger; Rush, 2014) .a non-linear would detract from the overall journey of discovery as the audience wouldn’t be able to gain the information of the documentary in the same order as Kamaal.</p> 

<p>To further gain a more immersive and narrative focused documentary we decided to include a personal video blog throughout the documentary to allow the viewer to gain an even greater insight to how the journey is effecting Kamaal and what he is learning during the development of the documentary. In addition to this I also wanted to portray a non bias representation of a vegan lifestyle for the documentary therefore I felt it was important to include a narrative voice of a meat eater to furthermore allow the audience to project themselves into the situation but also gain a non bias view.</p>
 
<h3>Technical aspects of editing used</h3>
 
<p>Within the documentary I have developed the transitions and cuts to give a similar overall experience of a personal journey for the viewer, I have done this by using a mainly jump cuts and fades to gain different effects. Firstly I have included a multitude of fades, this allows the user to visually see on screen time going by, I believe this allows the viewer to take the journey throughout the week with Kamaal and the people he visits. The two types of fades which I used where the cross fade between scenes to show a change of destination or time as well as a fade to black to show the ending of a specific part or the whole of the documentary. G. Moura (no date given) says that fade cuts “are used sparingly because they imply the end of a major story segment”. Another transition which I used within the documentary was a straight cut, this is when one image stops and another one starts with no transition, this is one of the most common transition which you will see on screen, maybe included hundreds of times within a popular movie. This allows the story to move on at a swift pace as too many fades can leave the story feeling very low pace.</p> 
 
<p>Another aspect of technical features which I added within the documentary was the cut away, this is a separate image which is shown on screen without audio giving the viewer more context about what is being said on either a voice over or an underlying interview. I have used these to develop the story and allows the viewer to gain further insight into the interviewee and the story which may be being told. I have used this in the round up video blog at the end of the documentary to give time for the audience to reflect on the overall documentary as Kamaal does over the audio.</p> 

<p>Another aspect which I would like to talk about is the walk though, this is when the audio of a scene starts however the visuals of the previous scene are still present, this allows the transition between scenes to occur much easier as the viewer is led into the scene before the visuals begin therefore the viewers mind makes it a smoother transition which makes the overall narrative link more effectively.</p>

<p>The final technical aspect which I will include is the on screen text thought-out the interviews in the documentary, I have included these to give the audience extra information on the subject as experts and people who are vegan or vegetarian, explain the lifestyle. This is a successful way of portraying text on the screen, however not distracting from the major story and narrative of the documentary as a blank screen would. </p>

<p>In conclusion the editor is a major part of the documentary making process and is responsible for the overall feel of the production in a number of ways which can be both physical such as the transitions within the production and the way the story is told such as linear or non-linear. </p>
